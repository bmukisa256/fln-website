            <h2>MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT|FOUNDER</h2>
            <p>"It is a delight to bring to you the good news from Female Lawyers’ Network (FLN) of an empowered Female
                Lawyers and the girl child in a gender-equal and just world.
                Female Lawyers’ Network is alive to the fact that gender equality is pivotal to the achievement of
                sustainable development not only in Uganda but in the world at large and this is the very reason as to
                why it comes to focus on core values of;<br>
                • Gender equality<br>
                • Good stewardship<br>
                • Empowerment<br>
                • Collaboration<br>
                which values not only benefit female lawyers but also the girl child in general. Because times are
                shifting and the world is evolving so fast, these core values allow women participate in decision making
                and even shape the direction of any movement as and when it comes forth thus eradicating gender
                inequalities, injustices and bias in all spaces worldwide.
                Women are not any different from men. Once empowered, they actually perform greatly, save for the weak
                background status driven by stereotypical cultural norms.<br>
                At Female Lawyers’ Network, we strongly believe and trust that female lawyers and the girl child be
                given a platform to make manifest of their greatness by involving them in the competitive atmospheres,
                decision making and many more such avenues to promote good governance and uphold the Rule of Law. I
                therefore urge us all to join the FLN noble cause to effectively walk the talk because we all are
                stakeholders in a gender-equal and just world.
                lift up a woman; Lift up society."<br>
                Hon Dr.Joyce Nalunga<br>
                President Female Lawyers’ Network (FLN)<br>
            </p>

            <h2>MESSAGE FROM CHAIRPERSON</h2>
            <p>"Female Lawyers Network.
                <br>
                To uphold women’s human rights is to ensure that every woman and girl lives up to her full potential.
                This year we celebrated the International Women’s Day under the theme DigitALL: Innovation and
                technology for gender equality”. We do not only celebrate the woman on this day but we also look to the
                future and think about what we have yet to achieve.
                The world today with the increase of technology there is a high likelihood that some people will be left
                behind. That is why the Female Lawyers Network seeks to reach out to girls who intend to influence the
                world through the law, so that they are not left behind
                I invite us to search within you and ask ourselves how can I facilitate a young girl to achieve their
                dream. I encourage you to cultivate a willingness within to look out for them, meet with them and invite
                them to the Female Lawyers Network.
                This way you will have contributed to a greater commitment of the Female Lawyers Network whose Mission
                is to <br>"Eradicate Gender injustices through engagement and awareness with women and girls to promote
                women rights, foster good governance and uphold Rule of Law in Africa"<br> and a Vision <br>"Empowered
                female lawyers and the girl child in a gender equal and just world".<br>
                I invite you all to subscribe to the Female Lawyers Network and make a difference in the life of a girl
                child.
